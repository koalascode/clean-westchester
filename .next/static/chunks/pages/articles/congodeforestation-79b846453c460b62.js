Specifically, the industries for palm oil, sugar, and rubber are some of the chief perpetrators of the land clearing in the Congolese Rainforest. Industrial logging is a major problem as well, and the consequences of clearcutting have been extensive.

Unfortunately, this is not the only way that deforestation in the Congo has accelerated climate change, as the massive reserves of carbon that rainforests hold are decreased each time a tree is cut down.
